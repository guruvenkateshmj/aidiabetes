## Introduction
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on various health-related features. Early detection of diabetes is crucial for timely medical intervention.

## Project Overview
Our model will utilize a dataset containing health parameters like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc., to make predictions. This project can have a significant impact on healthcare by helping identify individuals at risk of diabetes.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following:
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
